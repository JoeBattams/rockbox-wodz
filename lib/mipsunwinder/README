Slightly modyfied version which rips off OSE part and 64bit support.

1) Scan forward until return from function is found
2) Checks for SP adjustments to figure out stackframe size
3) Checks for RA restore
4) Unconditional jumps and branches are followed with the exception of jr rX form since register values are not tracked
5) Conditional branches are followed both ways starting with NOT TAKEN path
6) The search is bound to 128 branches, 128 jumps and 2048 instructions when determining stackframe
