The games that begin with the ``sgt-'' prefix are ports of certain
puzzles from Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection, an open source
collection of single-player puzzle games.

\subsubsection{Puzzle Documentation}
For documentation on the games included, please see the ``Extensive
Help'' menu option from inside the plugin to read puzzle-specific
instructions or visit their official website at
\url{https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/}.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Font Sizing}
By default, each game will only use one of two fonts in drawing: the
hard-coded system font for fixed-width text, and the theme's UI font
for variable-width text. For improved puzzle rendering, each puzzle is
capable of using a special font pack when it is installed. This font
pack is available from
\url{http://download.rockbox.org/useful/sgt-fonts.zip}. To install,
simply extract the contents of this file to the
\fname{/.rockbox/fonts/} directory on your device. Once this has been
done, each game will dynamically load and use properly-sized fonts
whenever needed.

\note{On hard disk-based devices, this may cause a slight delay as the
  disk spins up to load the fonts when a puzzle is first started, and
  after using the ``Extensive Help'' feature.}
